-[ ] Add axios

-[ ] Make a click = adding a new task (unranked) 
-[ ] Make a click = adding a new task, which will always appear on that point on the grid
-[ ] When a task is made, it is logged
-[ ] If there is something already there, view the saved task 
-[ ] You can delete a task
-[ ] You can mark a task as done (you log when it is done)


Decide on how I want the grid to work, currently not super happy on the solution where the edges are not clear. 

Change to absolute positioning for it to work 

Future validations jobs
-[ ] Nothing that is incomplete can have identical X and Y values (as a pair.)
