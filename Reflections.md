- #### Summary: Building a matrix grid
- #### Learnt 
  1. Firstly just consolidation from previous runs, understanding how to get started linking components. 
  2. Not a new thing, but I think firstly it was practising breaking a big project into smaller chunks. 
  Making milestones. Most importantly using this to then understand where there are gaps in my knowledge and when I want to fill them. 
  3. Don't jump into downloading a package. I found early on as a dev, I liked to download a package to fix my problem. 
     But this made a very complicated project, and I'd not really understand the pieces. Now, I instead see 
     looking to a package as a warning sign - am I making this too complicated (yes)? 
     (Links to point to - break things down into milestones.)
  4. Also just getting to grips with Vue CLI. 
  
  #### Achieved
  1. Got a basic grid going - simplifiedthe problem down, from neading a super reactive page. To just dots. 
  2. My tailwind understanding has come on quickly, all the practise is making it easy to guess what 
     the names of classes are for thing.
  3. Gave time to drawing basic design before diving in. This really helped make the flow quicker on my coding. 
  
  #### Targets (aka, improvement points)
  1. Keep avoiding adding packages, focus instead on simplifying problems or tackling it yourself. 
  2. Keep making sure you're always committing clean code
  3. Don't rush it early on - set up can feel dull. But thinking carefully about what structure etc you're using 
     will save time and stress in the long run. 
  
  #### Next steps (aka tasks rather than SI)
  1. Need to slow it down even more at the start. A little more planning time does help. 
  2. Get the points to change colour, when clicked.
  3. Have some way of storing which have been clicked and which have not. 
  4. Look at a way of hooking this up to a DB.
